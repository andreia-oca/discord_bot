# Discord bot

Discord bot deployed on a function-as-a-service infrastructure using queue management.

This is a great starter project that you can customize to meet your needs.
Feel free to fork it and deploy your own bot.

For now, the main features are:
- registering/unregistering commands
- a `/hello` world command
- a `/support` command that communicates with the OpenAI API

## Deploy the bot

## Test the bot locally

## Extend the bot with your own commands

## Future improvements

This project was used to better understand function-as-a-service model and how to d

Nonetheless, I believe this is a great starter for building reliable Discord bots, so I plan to improve it in the future.
My plan for now is to:
- add an admin panel to manage the bot commands (view commands, add/delete commands, etc.)

If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a even a pull request.
